Changes:

config_trAISformer.py:
		Changed values of "max_epochs", "batch_size" and "n_samples"

trainers.py:
		Added code block to solve import(and 'not defined') errors:
			 "from config_trAISformer import Config
				import os
				import matplotlib as plt
				import trAISformer as tf
				cf = Config()
				TB_LOG = cf.tb_log
				if TB_LOG:
				    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
    				tb = SummaryWriter()"
		Added a try-except loop around lines 270 to 301 to ensure that
		the code wouldn't throw an error while attempting to access the
		"test" section of data during the training phase(before it was defined).

trAISformer.py:
		Added the following line before the training loop even begins(line 54):
				"Data, aisdatasets, aisdls = {}, {}, {}"
		in order to solve '... is not defined' errors.

Unchanged:

datasets.py
models.py

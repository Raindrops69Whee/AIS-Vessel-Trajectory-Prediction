Method 6.

Currently tested: trans(x)+dense(x) --- Slightly less accurate
			     trans(x)+dense(trans(x)) --- Most accurate so far

Untested:	     x+dense(trans(x)) --- Not sure if this is even a good idea here

Combines multiple convolutional layers and uses batchnorm to form a dense layer, which is then stacked into a dense block.
Each layer can reference the previous layer(we simulate this using element-wise tensor addition)
